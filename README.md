# 🪄Introduction
This mod only adds a new item: Crystalline Eye of Ender.
Using Crystalline Eye of Ender, you can achieve two types of teleportation: fixed-point teleportation and random teleportation.

### Fixed-point Teleportation
Right click while sneaking to write your current position in the eye, then left or right click to teleport other mob or yourself back here.

### Random Teleportion
Directly left or right click to teleport other mob or yourself to a random position (the effect is like that of 🫐chorus fruit).

### Recipe
You can use 8 Amethyst Shard and 1 Eye of Ender to craft Crystalline Eye of Ender.
